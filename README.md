This is a simple eCommerce Project made with React JS, Context-API, Custom-Hook, Firebase, Material UI, React Bootstrap and Custom CSS3. Here I implemented a simple operation (Add-To-Cart and Remove from Cart, Showing food details) using fake JSON data and Open Food API and Login-Registration system (login with Google, Github, Email). Check this exciting project right now!
